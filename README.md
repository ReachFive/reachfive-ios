## Installation

### Cocoapods

Add the following line to your **Podfile**:

```
pod 'Reach5'
```

and other dependencies, for Social Login, as needed:
```
pod 'Reach5Facebook'
pod 'Reach5Google'
pod 'Reach5WeChat'
```


### Swift Package Manager
Open the following menu item in Xcode:

**File > Add Package Dependencies...**

In the **Search or Enter Package URL** search box enter this URL:

Then, select the dependency rule and press **Add Package**.

Or directly add it to the dependencies value of your Package.swift or the Package list in Xcode

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/ReachFive/reachfive-ios.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "7.0.0"))
]
```

## Usage
Refer to the [public documentation](https://developer.reachfive.com/sdk-ios/index.html) to install the SDKs and to initialize your ReachFive client.

The basics are:

- Configuration:

```swift
let reachfive: ReachFive = ReachFive(sdkConfig: SdkConfig(domain: "DOMAIN", clientId: "CLIENT_ID"))
```

- Initialisation:

Call this method (that makes a network call) inside the corresponding method of `UIApplicationDelegate`

```swift
reachfive.application(application, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions: launchOptions)
```
