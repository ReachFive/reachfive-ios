== Description

Opens an _insecure_ webview through the authorization endpoint:

* If end-users have an active in-app SSO session, the authorization endpoint immediately redirects to the application.
* If end-users do not have an active in-app SSO session, they are redirected to the client's Login URL for authentication.

[NOTE]
====
You must have configured a Login URL and enabled xref:docs:ROOT:orchestration-token.adoc[request orchestration tokens] for your identity client.
