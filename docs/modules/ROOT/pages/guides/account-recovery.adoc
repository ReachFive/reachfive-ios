= Account recovery

You can initiate account recovery with the xref:requestAccountRecovery.adoc[] or xref:requestPasswordReset.adoc[] method, depending on your implementation of our SDK.
In any case, account recovery is a multi-step account recovery process, which enables your users to regain access to their accounts by updating their password or resetting passkeys.

This guide outlines the steps required to implement the full flow, from triggering the recovery request to completing the action with a verification code.

Integrators must handle each step, including optional callback mechanisms, to ensure a seamless experience.

== Initiate the recovery request

// process visual here

First, you need to:

. Call xref:requestAccountRecovery.adoc[] or xref:requestPasswordReset.adoc[] with the user's identifier (e.g., email or phone number).
. Our SDK sends a verification code to the user via the configured channel (e.g., email/SMS).

== Capture the verification code

// second step visual here

*Optionally*, implement `<<addAccountRecoveryCallback>>` to automatically receive the verification code (e.g., via deep link) if supported.
Alternatively, provide a UI for manual verification code entry if callback isn't used.

=== addAccountRecoveryCallback

`addAccountRecoveryCallback` allows you to register a closure that automatically receives the verification code.
This is typically delivered via a deep link after the user interacts with the recovery email or SMS.

This optional approach eliminates the need for manual code entry by capturing the code directly in the app.
Once set, the closure is triggered by our iOS SDK with the verification code, which can then be passed to <<Complete the recovery process, updatePassword>> or <<Complete the recovery process, resetPasskeys>> to complete the recovery process.

Refer to xref:addAccountRecoveryCallback.adoc[] for further details.

== Complete the recovery process

// final step visual here

To complete the recovery process, use the verification code to finalize recovery:

. Call xref:updatePassword.adoc[] with the code and new password to update the user's password.
+
This is common for account recovery or password reset flows.

. Alternatively, call xref:resetPasskeys.adoc[] with the code to reset passkeys (specific to account recovery).
+
This applies only to the account recovery flow.

. Be sure to handle both success (e.g., “Recovery complete”) and errors (e.g., invalid/expired code).
