== About this command

Starts the MFA email registration flow.
When the flow is started, an email or SMS is sent to the user for verification depending on which `Credential` is used.

[NOTE]
====
*Email*:

If the user already has a verified email in their account, no additional verification code is sent.
If an existing email exists but is unverified, it becomes automatically verified with xref:mfaVerify.adoc[].

*Mobile*:

If the user already has a verified phone number with the same value in their account, no additional verification code is sent.
If an existing phone number exists with the same value but is unverified, it becomes automatically verified with xref:mfaVerify.adoc[].
