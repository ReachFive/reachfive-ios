AppDelegate.reachfive().refreshAccessToken(<<authToken>>)
----

== Description

Obtain a new `AuthToken` once your access token has expired.

[NOTE]
====
* An expired access token (short-lived) can be renewed using a refresh token (long-lived).
* Refreshing access tokens using an expired refresh token fails and invalidates all refresh tokens issued previously, for this {company} client only.
* The profile must have been granted the `offline_access` scope at the last authentication to obtain a refresh token.
* For refresh token to be included in your `AuthToken`, your client must be configured on the {cc} to enforce PKCE and to enable refresh tokens.
