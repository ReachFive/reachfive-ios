= Authentication

Once the user has a credential registered on the server and the device, they can use it to easily login with their identifier.

== Authentication process

The xref:loginWithWebAuthn.adoc[] method initiates the FIDO2 authentication process to retrieve the list of previously registered credentials and a challenge string from the server. This information is passed to the *FIDO2 CLIENT* which searches for a credential that matches the *Relying Party ID* and creates an *FaceID dialog* for the user to consent for authentication *(AuthenticationPublicKeyCredential)* .

After that the UI successfully retrieves the existing credential, the operation's result is returned to the ReachFive server and finalizes the FIDO2 authentication process by returning a _one-time authentication token_.

Finally, the result of the authentication callback request is parsed and the user's authentication token is retrieved.
