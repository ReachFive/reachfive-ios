The user requests to register a new account for the first time. Users don't need to provide a password, but instead provide an identifier like an email or mobile number as well as some personal data.

== Signup process

The xref:signupWithWebAuthn.adoc[] method initiates the FIDO2 signup process to retrieve a randomly generated challenge, the Relying Party information, and the user information from the {company} server. The options are then passed to the *FIDO2 CLIENT* which returns an *FaceId Dialog* to generates a new credential *(WebauthnSignupCredential)*.

Once the UI successfully generates a new credential, it sends the resulting data (which contains the information about this new credential) back to the {company} server and finalizes the FIDO2 signup process by returning a _one-time authentication token_.

Finally, the result of the authentication callback request is parsed and a user's authentication token is retrieved.
