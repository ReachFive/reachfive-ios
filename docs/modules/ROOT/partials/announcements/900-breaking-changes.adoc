= Breaking changes for `iOS 9.0.0`

There are several updates with our iOS SDK release that are considered breaking due to the migration from BrightFutures to Swift's native concurrency. 
Read the following for an overview of the changes.

== Swift concurrency or Reach5Future SDK

* The main {company} iOS SDK now uses `async throws` and `do-catch` for asynchronous operations.
+
See xref:guides/migrate-futures.adoc[] for details on migrating from BrightFutures to Swift's native concurrency.
* We have introduced the *Reach5Future SDK* compatibility bridge to maintain support for BrightFutures-based methods, allowing customers to continue using `Future` without immediate migration.
+
See xref:guides/migrate-reach5future.adoc[] for details on using the *Reach5Future SDK*.

You should choose between integrating the main SDK (Swift concurrency) or the *Reach5Future SDK* (BrightFutures compatibility) based on your project's needs.

== `ReachFiveError.message()` is deprecated

* The `ReachFiveError.message()` method is deprecated in both the main SDK and *Reach5Future SDK*.
* Use `Error.localizedDescription` or cast errors to `ReachFiveError` to access localized error descriptions in the `catch` clause or `.onFailure`.

== Integration checklist

[%interactive]
* [ ] Choose your SDK
* [ ] Update error handling
* [ ] Ensure UI updates (e.g., in `goToProfile`) are performed on the main thread.
* [ ] Check compilation: For *Reach5Future SDK*, explicitly specify return types in nested `.map` or `.flatMap` callbacks to avoid compilation errors.
